# ML ALGORITHMS

Applying Machine Learing Algorithms on datasets and evaluating them using performance metrics

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Linear Regression
- Support vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Natural Language Processing
- Association Rule Learning
- Reinforcemnt Learning

The python files for each of the algorithms can be found in the folders associated with them

They algorithms are simple to write, understand, and execute yet powerful in what they can do.
